***[CodeceptJS][1] Acceptance Tests with Cucumber and Saucelabs***


## About

> This framework contains Gherkin BDD Tests with CodeceptJS & uses Should.JS assertion library. Intgrated with Saucelabs to run on Multibrowsers in Parallel

* Scenarios are written in **Ghernkin BDD Syntax**, a.k.a `.feature` files. [Prefer writing Declartive Test Scenarios][2]

* Run on SauceLabs. Single browser or Multibrowsers in Parallel

* Uses [Should.js][3] Assertions Library. Various assertions with examples are available [here][7]

* Reduces Flakieness with **RetryFailedSteps** plugin and a Webdriver's **SmartWait**

* Page objects follow `<name_of_page>.page.js` naming pattern, and created under [pages][4] directory

* Step Definitions files follows `<name_of_step>.steps.js` naming pattern, and created under [step_definitions][5] directory

## Colocate CodeceptJS to your existing project

Follow this [Easy 3-Steps process][8] to setup CodeceptJS with Cucumber/Gherkin for your project

## Install

Prefer installing [yarn][6]

```bash
    cd codeceptjs-quick-start
    yarn
```

## Run Acceptance Tests

### Run all tests serially

Default browser is `chrome`

```bash
    yarn acceptance
```

To run on `firefox`

```bash
    yarn acceptance -- --profile firefox
```

To run on `headless` browser

```bash
    yarn acceptance --profile headless
```

### Run all tests parallel

```bash
    yarn acceptance:parallel
```

### Launch HTML Report

```bash
    yarn acceptance:report
```

## Saucelabs: Single or Multibrowsers in Parallel

This framework uses `wdio` to run tests on standalone selenium/on saucelabs platform. It can run tests in any requested Saucelabs browsers or can run Multibrowsers all in parallel.

Pass your required Sauce browsers thru `profile` param as described below

Important: Make sure to export your Sauce Username and Sauce Access Key as env variables

```bash
    export SAUCE_USERNAME=<sauce_username>
    export SAUCE_KEY=<sauce_key>
```

### Run on Single browser on Saucelabs

command: `yarn acceptance`
param: `--profile sauce:<sauce_browser>`
available browsers: `chrome`, `ie`, `edge`, `safari`, `firefox`

```bash
    yarn acceptance --grep @search_results --profile sauce:chrome
```

### Run Parallel on Multibrowsers on Saucelabs

command: `yarn acceptance:multibrowsers`
param: `--profile sauce:<first_sauce_browser>,<second_sauce_browser>,<and_so_on>`
available browsers: `chrome`, `ie`, `edge`, `safari`, `firefox`

```bash
    yarn acceptance:multibrowsers --grep @search_results --profile sauce:chrome,ie,safari
```
>

## Debug

To print debug messages, pass the `DEBUG` param

```bash
    DEBUG=acceptance* yarn acceptance --grep @search_results
```

## Sample Feature File

```bash

@search
Feature: Search Github

  In order to see Github Search works
  As a Github user
  I want to be able to search for repository

 @search_repository
  Scenario: Fred should see the highlighted results for the searched repository

    Given Fred is on Github Homepage
    When he searches for the "codeceptjs-quick-start"
    Then he sees all the detailed highlighted results including description or license info and many more
